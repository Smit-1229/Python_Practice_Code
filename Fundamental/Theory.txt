Python(Introduction)

     Python is higher level ,most popular, advance, Programing language.
     Python is an interpreter object oriented language.
     Python is very easy to understand language
     python has huge library collection.
     Python can be use in developing web application, mobile application, desktop application,etc..
     we can use python also in IOT, machine learing, Artificial intelligience, data analytics, data science, robotics, etc..

    Python Download 
         How to check wheather it is download or not?
             For android-
             Press Windows+R 
             Type "cmd" in dailoge box.
             Type "python --version".

             For mac or os
             Open terminal
             type"python --version"

             If it show the version than it was installed earlier.

        History of python-
             Python was invented by Guido Van Raisum.
             From his favorite comic"Monty Python's flyimg circus.

         visual studio is used to write the code for python.
         Juypiter is also i app to write the code for python.

Python IDLE:
     Python IDLE comes with the installation of python software.
     IDLE:Integrated Development learing Program.
     idle is use for learing purpose only. 
     We cannot execute multiple lines at same time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Print
     Print is an inbuild function in python.
     wich is used to display appropriate message on console screen.

     Syntax:Print("Appropriate message)

         There is huge difference between python 2 and python 3.
             In python 2:Print is a statement.
             Eg: print"Hello"
             
             In python 3:print is a function.
             Eg: print("Hello")

How to run ?
      step-1:Write code
      step-2:Right click on mouse
      Step-3:Click" Run python in terminal"
                   or
      Right side top corner there is run the code option.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\ Sequence(Escape)

      \ function is used to write or print  everthing after the \ function.
      For example:
           print("C:\\desktop\\python\\nodesjs")
           print("C:\\desktop\\python\nodesjs")            # In this \n show new line function

     \n is used for new line 
     \t is used for space in between words

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Comments

      Comments are ignored by compiler or interpreter.
      Comments are used for explanation of code.
      Comments we used for error handaling purpose.

      Types of comments:
           Single line comments: 
                It is used to comment in single line. 
                It is denoted by # symbol.
           Multiple line comments:
                It is used to comment two or more lines in coding.
                It is denoted by """ or 3times double inverted comma.

           For example: 
                #Hello
                """ Hello
                How are you?
                What are you doing"""


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables

      Variables is a name which can store a value.
      Variable can be used anywhere in program.
      In python there is no need to declare variable in python.
      That means no need to declae like int a, string b.

      For Example: 
           num = 10 #variable define
           name = "Smit" #variable define
           print(name)        # shows (Smit)
           print(num)         # shows (10)

      It is easy if we have a habbit of define variable in small letters.

      Variable declaration rules
           Variable name always contain 0-9,a-z and underscore.
           Variable name cannot start with 0-9(digit).
                name1(right)     1name(x)
           Variable name does not contain white space.
                first_name(right)        first name(x)
           A reserved or keyword cannot be use as a variable name.
           Make sure variable name start with small letters.


      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Datatypes
      Which type of value store in variable is called datatype.

      there are mainly three types of daatypes:

           1. Numeric:
                It contains number(0-9)
                It is of two types:
                     int(without point,eg-5000)
                     float(with point or decimal, eg-50.50)

           2. String:
                It contains character or alphabets(A-Z).
                It is denoted by str.

           3. True\False:
                It is also called as boolean value.
                It is denoted by bool.


      Type: 
           Type is a function to check which type of value is store in variable.


num = 10                            #numeric data type
name = "Smit"                       #String datatype(""is used for str)

print(type(name))                   #type fun is used to identify which datatype is used
print(type(num))                    #type fun is used to identify which datatype is used


Static value calculation

num1 = 20
num2 = 30

print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")

name = "python"                                    #another example
marks = 40

print("Name -",name)
print("Marks =",marks)
                  Or
print(f"My subject name is {name} & my marks is {marks}")    


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dynamic value
      In python we have input() functionfor dynamic value.
      Input(): it is an inbuilt function which is use to accept value at run time(dynamically) from user.
      By defult input function accept value in string format
      syntax: Variable name = input("appropriate prompt")

      Example:
           name = input("Enter your name here -")
           
           print(name)                     #result is (Enter your name here - Smit , Smit)

          
           num1 = input("Enter a number")
           num2 = input("Enter a number")
           ans = num1 + num2
           print(ans)                      #here ans is wrong due to input function accept value in str format
           print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")       #here ans is wrong due to input function accept value in str format
            
      To explict we have to convert in int format.
           num1 = int(input("Enter number 1 - "))                          #Solution for Dynamic variable 2
           num2 = int(input("Enter number 2 - "))                          #To accept value in integer format
           
           ans = num1 + num2 
           print(ans)
           
                        or

           print(f" {num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")

           
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
operators

      It is a specific symbol to perform specific operations
      eg: a + b,
      here a & b are operands(between a & b perform some operations thats why they are called operands)
      here + sign is operators

      Types of operators:
           1. Airthematic operators:
                +,-,*,/,**(Exponentation),//(Floor division)

           2. Assignment operators:
                = (to assign)
 
                Shorthand operators:
                     Combination of airthematic and assignment operators
                     e.g.- +=,-=,*=,/=,**=,//=.
                     here += can also be written as a = a+b

           3.Membership operators:
                in(to check specific element is a member for sequence)
                not in(to check specific element is not a member for sequence)


           4.  Identity operators:
                is
                is not
                Eg: 
                     a = 20
                     b = 10
                     c = a 
                     d = 20

                     print(a == b)                        # False
                     print(a is b)                        # False
                     print(a == c)                        # True
                     print(a is c)                        # True
                     print(a == d)                        # True
                     print(a is d)                        # True  

           5.Relational or comparission operantions:
                ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=.
           
           6. logical operator :
                and(it will return true when both condition goes true)
                or (it will return true when one of the condition goes true)
                not(it will return true when condition not fullfil)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Condition statement 
     There are mainly four statement:
          1. if Statement:
               It will execute when the condition goes is true.
               Syntax: if condition :
                                     statement
          2. if....else statement:
               It will execute true statement when condition is true and return false if it goes false.
               Syntax: if condition :
                                    true statement
                       else:
                                    false statement

          3. elif statement: 
               it will use for multiplecondition handaling.
               Syntax: if condition1 :
                                    true statement1
                       if condition2 :
                                    true statement2
                       if condition3 : 
                                    true statement3
                       else:
                                    false statement

          4.Nested if statement :
               when condition calling inside the operation.
               Syntax: if condition :
                                    if condition:
                                                  true statement
                                    else :
                                                  false statement
                       else:
                                    if condition:
                                                  true statement
                                    else :
                                                  false statement
